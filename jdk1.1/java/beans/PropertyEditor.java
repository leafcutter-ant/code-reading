/**
 * A PropertyEditor class provides support for GUIs that want to
 * allow users to edit a property value of a given type.
 * <p>
 * PropertyEditor supports a variety of different kinds of ways of
 * displaying and updating property values.  Most PropertyEditors will
 * only need to support a subset of the different options available in
 * this API.
 * <P>
 * Simple PropertyEditors may only support the getAsText and setAsText
 * methods and need not support (say) paintValue or getCustomEditor.  More
 * complex types may be unable to support getAsText and setAsText but will
 * instead support paintValue and getCustomEditor.
 * <p>
 * Every propertyEditor must support one or more of the three simple
 * display styles.  Thus it can either (1) support isPaintable or (2)
 * both return a non-null String[] from getTags() and return a non-null
 * value from getAsText or (3) simply return a non-null String from 
 * getAsText().
 * <p>
 * Every property editor must support a call on setValue when the argument
 * object is of the type for which this is the corresponding propertyEditor.
 * In addition, each property editor must either support a custom editor,
 * or support setAsText.
 * <p>
 * Each PropertyEditor should have a null constructor.
