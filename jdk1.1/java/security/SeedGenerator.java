/**
 * This class exports a single static method (genSeed) that generates
 * a seed for a cryptographically strong random number generator.  The
 * goal is to provide a seed whose least significant byte is "truly random."
 * The seed is produced by creating a "sleeper thread" that sleeps for a
 * designated time period, and spinning on Thread.yield() while waiting
 * for the sleeper thread to terminate.  The parent thread keeps track of
 * the number of times that it yields, and returns this "spin count"
 * as a seed.  Remarkably, the low order bits of this seed seem to be
 * quite random.
